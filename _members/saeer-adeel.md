Saeer completed his M.Sc. in Molecular Genetics in 2021 as a member of both the Doxey and Moffatt labs. His research focused on investigating the physiological effects of altered sulfur metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana. Stemming from that study, he also examined the molecular basis of plant domestication by identifying residues associated with human selection.
