Benjamin completed his PhD in the Doxey Lab in 2023. His thesis work explored the functional characterization of flagellinolysin - a family of bacterial flagellins (discovered by our laboratory in 2017) that possesses a unique protease domain in the surface-exposed hypervariable region. Ben is currently a PDF in the Fritz Lab at the University of Western Australia.
