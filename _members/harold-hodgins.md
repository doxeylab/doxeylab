Harold is an PhD student and Vanier Scholar in the Doxey lab. His work focuses on petabase scale data-mining and its use in expansion of species and pan-genome diversity. 

Previously, he obtained a B.Sc. from Wilfrid Laurier University in Computer Science with minors in Applied Mathematics and Electronics. While at Wilfrid Laurier he worked with several labs in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Health Science and Psychology and spent a summer working in a cancer research lab programming a liquid handling robot.

Harold is interested in using automation to help answer bigger questions in research. When not running multi-terabyte analyses on Compute Canada Supercomputers, he can be found in the wet lab developing tools to automate fundamental biological research.
