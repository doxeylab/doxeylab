Harold is an M.Sc. student in the Doxey lab using petabyte scale searches to study diverse neurotoxins. Previously, he obtained a B.Sc. from Wilfrid Laurier University in Computer Science with minors in Applied Mathematics and Electronics. While at Wilfrid Laurier he worked with several labs in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Health Science and Psychology and spent a summer working in a cancer research lab programming a liquid handling robot.

Harold is interesting in using automation to help answer bigger questions in research. When not running multi-terabyte analyses on Compute Canada Supercomputers, he can be found in the wet lab developing tools to automate fundamental biological research.
