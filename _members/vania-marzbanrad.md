Iâ€™m a fifth-year Honours Biology student, minoring in Medical Physiology and Psychology. I am currently working on my undergraduate thesis project, which focuses on understanding the roles of two novel proteins, VCBS and flagellinolysin, in Pseudoalteromonas tunicata. I am using Western blotting to quantify their expression in both planktonic and biofilm stages, as well as RNA sequencing to analyze their gene regulation during biofilm development.
