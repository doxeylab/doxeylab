# Biology as a Data Science

The Doxey lab is a bioinformatics research lab at the University of Waterloo, in the Department of Biology and cross-affiliated to the Cheriton School of Computer Science. We develop and use <bf>computational</bf> approaches to analyze and compare genomes, and we apply <bf>experimental</bf> approaches to characterize new gene families and functions that we predict from data. Our work spans several fields including: pathogen biology, gene/protein function prediction, evolutionary genomics, and omics analysis of human disease.

We are lucky to work with numerous research groups around the world, and we are always looking for new collaborations. Don't hesitate to contact us!

# Highlights

{% capture text %}
Our lab's research centers around the use of bioinformatic methods to predict novel biological phenomena. We generate and analyze datasets using omic approaches, and we also pursue novel predictions experimentally in the wet-lab. Some of the ongoing projects in our lab include:

* Large-scale phylogenomic analysis of the bacterial and archaeal tree of life
* Pathogen detection and analysis using clinical metagenomics
* Proteomics discovery and functional characterization of novel biofilm-associated proteins
* Bioinformatics, classification and evolution of bacterial protein toxins
* Data-mining of the NCBI sequence read archive
* Experimental characterization of flagellinolysin
